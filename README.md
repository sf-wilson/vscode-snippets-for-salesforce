# Snippets for Salesforce Developers
A suit of VSCode Snippets that will help Salesforce Developers to boost their productivity!

The [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) has already some code snippets to be used in Apex, Javascript and even... specific for LWC!
However, **this collection of Snippets focuses on covering other aspects of a developer's daily tasks (probably less funny), like commenting your code and creating your components documentation!** So, what's included?
 - APEX Snippets to include structured comments in methods and classes
 - AURA Snippets including all the elements you need to create incredible auradoc files
